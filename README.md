# Using ETL for Amazing Prime!
### Background
Amazing Prime, a phantasm of a company resembling Amazon, is planning a hackathon, or a week-long event in which participants use provided data and compete against one another to solve a problem. They will be using data from three separate files, one of which is based off a Wikipedia web scrape, which is often very messy data.
### Purpose
The purpose of the project is to create functions that extract data, transform it, then load it as SQL files in Postgresql tables. This will save the participants all the trouble of cleaning and troubleshooting their code and will allow them to all start from the same clean data set.
### Contents
In the main folder, the Amazing_Prime(ETL).ipynb file holds all of the processes used throughout the module to successfully perform ETL - including notes containing the writer's thought process. Within the Amazing_Prime_challenge folder, you will find all four deliverables used to complete the challenge for this module. The final deliverable, ETL_create_database.ipynb, is the final product that performs a complete ETL on the inputs. Two screenshots were saved showing that the ratings and movies table within SQL contained the correct number of rows as the original file did before it was streamlined, per the challenge. The screenshots can be found within the Resources folder inside of the challenge folder.
